# Shooting Sprite Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully added a shooting sprite to your portal game that appears when you enable portal mode and disappears when you exit portal mode or successfully create a portal.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Sprite Creation
- **Sprite Used**: `reddot.png` from your Assets folder
- **Variable**: `shooting_sprite` (declared as a global variable)
- **Physics**: Has rigidbody with gravity enabled
- **Scale**: 0.3x scale for appropriate size

### 2. Behavior

#### When Portal Mode is Enabled (Press 'E'):
- The shooting sprite appears at the player's position (slightly above at +0.5 Y offset)
- It has full physics enabled including gravity
- It will fall and interact with the game world

#### When Portal Mode is Disabled:
The shooting sprite is hidden (moved to position -100, -100) in the following scenarios:
- **Press 'E' again** - Toggles portal mode off
- **Successfully create a portal** - When you fire a portal with left mouse button
- **Reset portals with 'R'** - When you reset all portals
- **Reset to entrance with 'Q'** - When you reset the level

### 3. Code Changes Made

#### Added Variables:
```javascript
// Shooting sprite for portal mode
let shooting_sprite = null;
```

#### Added Sprite Creation:
```javascript
// Create shooting sprite (initially hidden)
shooting_sprite = instantiate_sprite("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coffeecookey/SICP-JS/main/Assets/reddot.png");
```

#### Added Functions:
```javascript
const shooting_sprite_start = (self) => {
    set_scale(self, vector3(0.3, 0.3, 1));
    apply_rigidbody(self, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, true);
    // Initially hide the shooting sprite
    set_position(self, vector3(-100, -100, 0));
};

const shooting_sprite_update = (self) => {
    // The shooting sprite will be positioned by the portal mode logic
    // No special update logic needed here
};
```

#### Modified Portal Mode Toggle:
- Added logic to show/hide the shooting sprite when 'E' is pressed
- Sprite appears at player position when entering portal mode
- Sprite is hidden when exiting portal mode

#### Modified Portal Creation:
- Added logic to hide the shooting sprite when a portal is successfully created

#### Modified Reset Functions:
- Added logic to hide the shooting sprite when portals are reset ('R' key)
- Added logic to hide the shooting sprite when level is reset ('Q' key)

### 4. Function Registration:
```javascript
set_start(shooting_sprite, shooting_sprite_start);
set_update(shooting_sprite, shooting_sprite_update);
```

## How to Test

1. Start the game
2. Press 'E' to enter portal mode - you should see the red dot sprite appear and fall with gravity
3. Press 'E' again - the sprite should disappear (move to -100, -100)
4. Press 'E' to enter portal mode again
5. Aim and fire a portal with WASD + Left Mouse Button - the sprite should disappear when the portal is created
6. Try the 'R' and 'Q' keys to verify the sprite is hidden during resets

## Notes

- The sprite is positioned at -100, -100 when hidden, ensuring it's completely off-screen
- The sprite has full physics enabled, so it will interact with the game world when visible
- The implementation is integrated with all existing portal mode functionality
- No existing game mechanics were disrupted by this addition
